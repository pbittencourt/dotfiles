foreground #5c6a72
background #fffbef

#: The foreground and background colors

# background_opacity 1.0

#: The opacity of the background. A number between 0 and 1, where 1 is
#: opaque and 0 is fully transparent.  This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the background color's opacity in
#: cells that have the same background color as the default terminal
#: background. This is so that things like the status bar in vim,
#: powerline prompts, etc. still look good.  But it means that if you
#: use a color theme with a background color in your editor, it will
#: not be rendered as transparent.  Instead you should change the
#: default background color in your kitty config and not use a
#: background color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape
#: codes to set the terminals default colors in a shell script to
#: launch your editor.  Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a
#: (possibly significant) performance hit.  If you want to dynamically
#: change transparency of windows set dynamic_background_opacity to
#: yes (this is off by default as it has a performance cost)

# background_image none

#: Path to a background image. Must be in PNG format.

# background_image_layout tiled

#: Whether to tile or scale the background image.

# background_image_linear no

#: When background image is scaled, whether linear interpolation
#: should be used.

# dynamic_background_opacity no

#: Allow changing of the background_opacity dynamically, using either
#: keyboard shortcuts (increase_background_opacity and
#: decrease_background_opacity) or the remote control facility.

# background_tint 0.0

#: How much to tint the background image by the background color. The
#: tint is applied only under the text area, not margin/borders. Makes
#: it easier to read the text. Tinting is done using the current
#: background color for each window. This setting applies only if
#: background_opacity is set and transparent windows are supported or
#: background_image is set.

# dim_opacity 0.75

#: How much to dim text that has the DIM/FAINT attribute set. One
#: means no dimming and zero means fully dimmed (i.e. invisible).

# selection_foreground #000000

#: The foreground for text selected with the mouse. A value of none
#: means to leave the color unchanged.

# selection_background #fffacd

#: The background for text selected with the mouse.


#: The 256 terminal colors. There are 8 basic colors, each color has a
#: dull and bright version, for the first 16 colors. You can set the
#: remaining 240 colors as color16 to color255.
